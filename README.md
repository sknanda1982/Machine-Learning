# Heart Risk Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm
Today the heart disease is one of the most important causes of death in the world. So, its early prediction and diagnosis 
is important in medical field, which could help in on time treatment, decreasing health costs and decreasing death caused by 
it. In fact, the main goal of using data mining algorithms in medicine by using patients’ data is better utilizing the database
and discovering tacit knowledge to help doctors in better decision making. Therefore, using data mining and discovering knowledge 
in cardiovascular centres could create a valuable knowledge, which improves the quality of service provided by managers, and could 
be used by doctors to predict the future behaviour of heart diseases using past records. Also, some of the most important applications 
of data mining and knowledge discovery in heart patient’s system includes: diagnosing heart attack from various signs and properties, 
evaluating the risk factors which increases the heart attack. Here various type of Machine Learning Model were used. 

# Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability.

We can call a Logistic Regression a Linear Regression model but the Logistic Regression uses a
more complex cost function, this cost function can be dened as the `Sigmoid function' or also
known as the `logistic function' instead of a linear function. The hypothesis of logistic regression tends it to limit the cost function between 0 and 1. Therefore linear functions fail to represent it as it can have a value greater than 1 or less than 0 which
is not possible as per the hypothesis of logistic regression.
